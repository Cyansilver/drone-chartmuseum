# Drone plugin for ChartMuseum

Drone plugin to package and upload Helm charts to ChartMuseum

Supported storage services:

- AWS S3

When managing Charts for your organisation, you may either choose to put Chart definitions within each project or centralised in a `helm-charts` repository.

Keeping Charts in a central repository allows a more flexible definition of how each project is deloyed and a full decoupling of the projects (similar to the central public-charts repo)

This plugin provides a Drone build step to package and update the Helm Repository for centralised charts repository.

In this case, we are using ChartMuseum for our centralised charts repository.

## Usage

Drone Usage:

- `diff` mode:

In this mode, the plugin will retrieve the changed files between `previous_commit` and `current_commit`, and only create helm charts & upload to server for those.

```YAML
pipeline:
  chartmuseum-diff:
    image: quay.io/honestbee/chartmuseum:v1
    repo_url: http://helm-charts.example.com
    mode: diff
    previous_commit: ${DRONE_PREV_COMMIT_SHA}
    current_commit: ${DRONE_COMMIT_SHA}
    when:
      branch: [master]

```

- `all` mode:

All helm charts under `chart_dir` would be packaged and upload to server.

```YAML
pipeline:
  chartmuseum-diff:
    image: quay.io/honestbee/chartmuseum:v1
    repo_url: http://helm-charts.example.com
    mode: all
    when:
      branch: [master]

```

- `single` mode:

Only specific chart defined by `chart_path` would be taken care of.

```YAML
pipeline:
  chartmuseum-diff:
    image: quay.io/honestbee/chartmuseum:v1
    repo_url: http://helm-charts.example.com
    mode: single
    chart_path: nginx
    when:
      branch: [master]

```
